## About Project

This project is intended for a user to randomly generate a password for any type of security purpose. As the website guides them through the process of determining how they would like their password setup, based on their user input for preferences, a password will generate at random within those parameters.

### How the project functions

Through javascript code, an "EventListener" function is triggered when the user clicks on the "Generate Password" button in which it will prompt the user to answer the following questions.

- How many characters they wish their password to be (between 8-128 characters)
- If they wish their password to contain numbers
- If they wish their password to contain special characters (i.e. !@#$, etc.)
- If they wish their password to contain upper case letters
- If they wish their password to contain lower case letters

***If the user answers the prompt outside of the required criteria, the user will be alerted to start the process over and to answer within the requirements asked of them.***

Once all prompts are completed properly, the user will be provided a randomly generated password within the text box for them to use as needed.
